I live in Crested Butte, Colorado, which is surrounded by public lands and hundreds of miles of multiuse trails. Last year, the Gunnison-Crested Butte Tourism Association, the Town of Crested Butte, Gunnison County, and local trail associations decided to embark on a community trail mapping initiative to provide accurate trail maps to trail users via a cbgtrails.com app that can download trail signs so users can follow free public trail maps on their phones.  

My company, JuicyTrails, was selected to create the cbgtrails.com app and all the trail signs. We used the OpenStreetMap iD editor to collaborate with community stakeholders like the USFS Gunnison Ranger District, Gunnison County, the Town of Crested Butte, and local trail associations to accurately map over 1200 miles of trails and 900 miles of access roads. The cbgtrails.com map and trail signs share the same multi-user trail map style, which colors trails according to their permitted uses and is built entirely from OpenStreetMap data. 

The cbgtrails.com project has received remarkably positive feedback from trail users and community stakeholders alike. 

This project showcases how a community and its trail users benefit when public trail maps are built with OpenStreetMap data.
