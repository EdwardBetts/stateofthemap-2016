As OpenStreetMap becomes more important and changes even faster, accidental edits and intentional vandalism happen more often and have more impact. We're working on these problems holistically: fixing issues every day, using existing tools, improving editing software, and building new workflows for emerging problems.

We're very keen to gather feedback and ideas from the community, and get more people involved in this effort. My talk will cover some of the technical details and challenges behind the tools and workflows we are building and work to open up a broader discussion around how the OpenStreetMap community can detect and respond to errors in the shortest possible time.
