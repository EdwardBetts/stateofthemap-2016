WeeklyOSM collates all the current news and ongoings in OpenStreetMap. We'd love to be able to publish weeklyOSM in more languages and expand the number of authors across all languages. During this workshop you will receive training in our content management system: OSM Blog Collector (OSMBC).

Learn how to collect and edit articles. We explain what EN ES, OSM Calender2Markdown and Picture Tool are, and how to use them. We provide all you need to get to grips with the Admin Area in OSMBC. Following this session you will be experienced in OSMBC and will be able to help spread WeeklyOSM to your local community.
