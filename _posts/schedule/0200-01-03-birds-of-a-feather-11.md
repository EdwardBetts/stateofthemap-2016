On Friday, Saturday and Sunday of State of the Map, we will have several spaces for informal "Birds of a Feather" (BoFs). These are informal get meetings, planned ahead or thought up spontaneously. Discussions, mapping, code and documentation sprints, and hacking sessions, whatever you want! The sessions will take place in the Foyer and "Building D" classrooms, adjacent to the main conference hall. We will have a sign up board prominently in the main area to schedule sessions and add ideas.

For now, start to share and discuss your ideas by posting them on [http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/State_Of_The_Map_2016/Informal_Sessions#Birds_of_a_Feather_Sessions](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/State_Of_The_Map_2016/Informal_Sessions#Birds_of_a_Feather_Sessions)
