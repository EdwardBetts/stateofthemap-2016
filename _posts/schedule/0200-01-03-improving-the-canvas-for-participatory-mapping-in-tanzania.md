At Crowd2Map Tanzania we are working on engaging as much local participation in mapping, since most of the map still remains blank, and large areas remain limited to local knowledge, especially so in rural Tanzania. 

We have explored different apps to facilitate mapping that could work despite the low literacy and limited technological capabilities of participants. We have now settled on using Maps.me app due the ability to edit OSM directly. However, the usually blank base map makes it very difficult for locals to map their communities accurately.  In turn, editing collected Maps.me points in the OSM can be challenging. 

During the workshop we will engage in hands-on mapping to bring Maps.me points (which have been collected so far my locals in Tanzania) to OSM standards. We will also work on the ways to make ground mapping more effective, e.g. by creating better base maps. By tapping the rich experience of the OSM community, we envision the main outcome of the workshop to be a solid long-term plan to facilitate effective ground mapping in the local communities that could be scalable to any developing country.
