Mohamet Lamine Ndiaye will present OpenStreetMap Senegal, history, voluntary activities since 2012 (advocacy, training, field mapping, mapathons) and interactions with other OSM communities in West Africa and worldwide

Dibloni Innocent Soungalo will briefly introduce OpenStreetMap in Burkina Faso, focusing on the activities of the OpenStreetMap association of Burkina Faso. That includes promotion of OSM, achievements and goals. He is one of the founding members of this association, which is the main focus of OSM activity when it comes to mapathons, surveys, training and sensitization workshops with various parties interested in free geodata. We also work with other open data communities, private or government organisations to help them discover OSM and the many use cases it could have for them.
