URISAâ€™s GISCorps (www.giscorps.org) coordinates short term volunteer GIS services to underserved communities worldwide.

Since its inception in October 2003, the Corps has attracted +/- 4,200 volunteers from over 96 countries. To date, GISCorps has deployed 957 volunteers to 183 missions in 56 countries. These volunteers have contributed over 30,000 working hours in disaster and non-disaster response missions including in the United States, Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Africa. 

This presentation will focus on recent crowd sourcing and work of our volunteers in OpenStreetMap.
