We’ll present the Los Angeles Building Import team’s efforts in the planning, implementation and local outreach in the L.A. region.

While the building import includes data on building heights, uses and the number of housing units, it also brings Angelenos into the OpenStreetMap community. We’ll describe the import guidelines established by the OpenStreetMap community, the collaboration in Github and the OpenStreetMap Wiki, quality testing and the next steps to import addresses and other data. We’ll discuss the import phases including hosting local mapping parties and teaching people how to use JOSM and the ID editor.

We believe that contributors of all backgrounds should be able to contribute in any way possible. Our goal is to train more people to improve southern California’s map data and strengthen the local mapping community.
