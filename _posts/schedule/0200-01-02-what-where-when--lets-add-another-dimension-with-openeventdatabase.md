OSM data represent a "static" world and is not designed to share time related data. As an example, we can do route calculations but they cannot take into account traffic jams, closed roads or road work.

OpenEventDatabase's goal is to provide an open platform to share "events" which are data with "what", "where" and "when" details.
An open API is available since May 2016 and the project is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/openeventdatabase).
The content is currently fed with weather warnings and alerts and motorway traffic information, with more planned.
