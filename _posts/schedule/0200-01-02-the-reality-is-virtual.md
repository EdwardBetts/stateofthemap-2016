College students impact the U.S. Governmentâ€™s work in a wide variety of ways. Through the Virtual Student Foreign Service (VSFS), both the State Department's MapGive Initiative and USAID have enrolled over 30 VSFS interns for the 2015-2016 school year. These highly-motivated students from universities across the country have received in depth training on OpenStreetMap and have worked on editing and validating tasks in support of both humanitarian initiatives and for mapping highly at risk countries. The work these Virtual Interns have done has added incredibly valuable data to the analytical products of the two offices.

We will cover the projects these students have worked on, lessons learned, and how students can get involved next year.
