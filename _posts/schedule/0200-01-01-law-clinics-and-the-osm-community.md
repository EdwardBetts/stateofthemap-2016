Law clinics provide high quality, pro-bono legal services and a real practical experience for students. This past semester, the CyberLaw Clinic at Harvard Law School worked with OpenStreetMap US to conduct legal research, interviews, and analysis on the relationships among the ODbL, OpenStreetMap, and the specific issue of geocoding.

We'll present on the experience of working with the OpenStreetMap community, the results from the clinic, and ideas for how legal advice and processes can continue to benefit the community on all levels.
