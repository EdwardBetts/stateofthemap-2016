The first part of the talk will introduce Mapillary for the audience and how they can contribute their own content. Then give an overview of the different data endpoints of Mapillary, for example images, object detections (e.g. street signs), objects and vector tiles.

Then we will look at different integrations like OpenStreetMap iD editor, JOSM, Wiki Loves Monuments and others using portions of this data to improve or document physical spaces.

Also, the talk will cover different Open Source integration libs like OpenSfM, MapillaryJS and the iD editor.
