Anyone who has edited OpenStreetMap has used DigitalGlobe (DG) imagery; they might not realize it, they might refer to it as “Bing” or “Nextview”, but all OpenStreetMap users are DG users.

DigitalGlobe is the team who are building, launching, operating and provisioning high resolution, accurate images that power OpenStreetMap. This talk will cover how DG will continue to innovate and provide data to OpenStreetMap that will allow OpenStreetMap to go to the next level in terms of coverage, relevance and detail. I will also cover our Open Data initiative and ecosystem of baller partners in the Geo industry.

Lastly, if the Seattle weather cooperates with us, I will coordinate a “Selfie from Space” like we did at State of the Map US 2015. Time and place to be announced.
