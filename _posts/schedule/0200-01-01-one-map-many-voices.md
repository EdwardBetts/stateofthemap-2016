Even though OpenStreetMap represents one unified map, the community consists of many different individuals and organizations. Each of these members brings to the project their own experiences and goals, which can sometimes conflict. Some example reasons could be differences between newcomers and the experienced, individuals and corporations, or those with specialized knowledge and the general public. 

To go along with the conference theme, I would like to discuss how we currently resolve issues within OpenStreetMap, and how we might be able to do better.
