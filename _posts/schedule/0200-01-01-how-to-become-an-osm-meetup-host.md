Organizing OpenStreetMap Meetups is a lot of fun but also a lot of work. In this talk I will discuss how to start a new meetup group, plan a meetup, where to find and hold meetups, give some tips and tricks and growing your your group.

We will look at the cost of running a meetup and look at offseting some of those costs.

The talk will be based on my experience with jointly hosting the Seattle OpenStreetMap Meetup with Chase Stephens.
