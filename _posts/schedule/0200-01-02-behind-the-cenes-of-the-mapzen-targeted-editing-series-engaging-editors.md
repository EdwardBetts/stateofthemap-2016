When faced with a screen full of map features, it can be difficult to know where a contribution is needed.  The Mapzen Targeted Editing Series was designed to engage editors with intuitive visualizations of easily editable OpenStreetMap features.  This talk takes you behind the scenes into the discovery process of topics, tags and tiles.  See which themes resulted in the most engagement, and a summary of the contributions from our community of editors.
