There is a hunger within academia to learn about, and to participate in, OpenStreetMap. However, many professors / instructors and students need a push, and a little help, from someone in the OpenStreetMap community to get started. The presenter will speak about his experiences working with institutions of higher learning (and the GIS community) in Colorado. He has worked with Colorado State University in Fort Collins, University of Northern Colorado in Greeley, The University of Wyoming in Laramie (Wyoming), and Front Range Community College in Longmont.  He has been a guest lecturer, delivered presentations about OpenStreetMap at university sponsored conferences (and GIS industry events), and organized mapathons in cooperation with these institutions.  Attendees will learn how to get started making contact with people in higher education, how to work effectively with staff and students, the need to be sensitive to the educational institution’s goals and objectives and not “step on toes”, the desirability of the OpenStreetMap volunteer also becoming part of the institution’s “community”, and how to host successful events.
