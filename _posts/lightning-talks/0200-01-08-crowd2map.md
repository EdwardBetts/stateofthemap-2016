Crowd2Map Tanzania is focused on putting rural Tanzania on the map, having Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in mind. Our attention is currently on mapping a region of Mara, where female genital mutilation (FGM) is widespread. By mapping roads, villages and schools we lay ground for the essential outreach work carried out by Mugumu Safe House in the neighbouring villages. This helps us reach girls at risk, both logistically (to do basic outreach), as well as give the girls confidence to flee their homes by an ability to find the Safehouse easier. The Safehouse also provides the girls with vocational training and community support, which make a major difference in their future lives. Our mapping therefore has a multilevel impact, including improving gender equality (SDG 5), health (SDG 3) and education (SDG 4).
