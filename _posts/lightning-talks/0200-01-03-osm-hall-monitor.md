This session will introduce the OSM Hall Monitor, a Python module that employs a watch list to screen recent changes to OSM for activity by users, modifications to certain objects, and edits involving specific tags. It also provides the option to notify a subscriber whenever a flagged event occurs. The Hall Monitor is demonstrated in the context of a user monitoring workflow, though its utility is manifold.
