The core strength of OpenStreetMap lies in its open map data. What makes it even better is it being available in over a thousand languages. In order to make this a truly powerful tool, map data needs to be available in local languages - just as good as in English. This is where we see a challenge  - lack of richness in data in local languages. This talk discusses the need for contribution to Map Internationalization with focus on both translation of map data as well as localisation of OSM tools and software to break any barriers contributors might face. The case study for this talk is use of local language maps in India. With over 20 Indic languages, the potential of Indian map data is immense when available in local languages. Efforts in this direction would not only increase OSM's value but also throw the community open to more people to use and contribute to OSM by breaking the language barrier.
