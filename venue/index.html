          <p>The Vrije Universiteit Brussel is the offshoot of the French-speaking Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) that was founded in 1834 by a Brussels lawyer with Flemish origins, Pierre-Théodore Verhaegen. He wanted to establish a university that would be independent from the state and the church and where academic freedom would reign.</p>

      <p>This year we have partnered with the Brussels Booking Desk to provide reduced hotel rates for State of the Map. And the OSM community is collecting details on <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/State_Of_The_Map_2016/Community_info">more local accommadation options on the wiki</a>.
      
      <p>For Brussels Booking Desk, it's simple to book through the <a href="https://secure.hotel.visitbrussels.be/extendedSearch?package=849&lang=en">dedicated reservation website</a>. They are also on hand to assist with any accommodation enquiries you may have before, during and after your stay! These pre-booked rates are limited so we ask that you book as early as possible.</p>
